# Weather-Dashoboard

06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

This project is a weather dashboard that allows a user to view the weather in cities of their choice by putting an input into the search bar. The dashboard displays the current weather and then also the weather for the next 5 days. After a user has made a search their search is saved to local storage and then pulled back out on the web application when they leave the page and come back or if they refresh the page.
## Acceptance criteria

In order for the project to be considered finished, certain criteria had to be met. The criteria included:

* info that should be displayed is the city name, date, an icon, temp, wind ,humidity and uv index and all of that info is for the current day
* uv index should present a color that signals to the conditions(if it is moderate,severe, etc.)
